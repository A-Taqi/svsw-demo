# Stateless vs Stateful Widgets - DEMO (CODED)

This is a demo for Coded.

## Setup Instructions

1. [Set up an editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) (This project was done with **VS Code**).
2. In VS Code, go to **Run** > **Start Debugging**
3. Choose **Chrome** or your favorite browser
4. Wait to see the project's main page which should say *Welcome to the Demo!*

## Demo Objectives

The objective of this Demo is to demonstrate the usage of Stateless vs Stateful Widgets. To do that,
we will be making a simple form where the user will enter their name in an input field, click a button
and be greeted personally by the app. Let's get cooking üç≥!

1. Create a ***Stateful*** Widget which will hold our form.
2. Create a ***Stateful*** Widget which will hold our input field.
2. Create a ***Stateless*** Widget which will display our personalized greeting text.
3. Create a ***Stateless*** Widget which will hold our button to submit the name to the greeting text.

## Note
The folder `lib/widgets/` has been conveniently created for you should you wish to separate your widgets there.

## Tips
In **VS Code**, you have the following shortcuts that can come in handy:
* Typing `stless` in a file will automatically insert a `StatelessWidget`
* Typing `stful` in a file will automatically insert a `StatefulWidget`
